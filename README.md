# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-means-and-RFM-Analysis

This project focuses on customer segmentation using K-means clustering and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis. The goal is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior and provide insights for targeted marketing strategies.

Overview
* Perform RFM analysis to calculate recency, frequency, and monetary values for each customer.
* K-means clustering to segment customers into distinct groups based on RFM values.
* Utilize the elbow and silhouette methods to determine the optimal number of clusters for K-means.
* Use percentile-based separation to create RFM segments.
* Employ concatenation and summation techniques to create RFM scoring.
* Visualize the customer segments using scatter plots, bar plots, or box plots.
